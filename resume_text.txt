Master of Science , Computer Graphics , Expected in 01/2025
As part of my Master's in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, I am working on
developing a smoke simulation using the RBF-FD technique. This technique leverages
radial basis functions to discretize the partial differential equations governing smoke
behavior, allowing for more accurate and efficient simulations. Smoke simulation is an
important area in computer graphics, used in games, movies, and other visual
applications. I am excited to contribute to advancements in this field and look forward to
sharing my results soon.
